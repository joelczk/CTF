This is cryptography challenge. You are given ciphertext and the key.\
Upon observation, one can see that this is a `Vignere Cipher`\
Given the key and the ciphertext, we can easily decrypt it using any online tool such as [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

The flag is : `picoCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}`
