This is another easy challenge where you have to observe the java code provided to find the flag \
Observing the java code provided, we notice the following lines of code:
```
public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    return password.equals("w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_3808d338b46");
}
```
Hence, the flag is `picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_3808d338b46}`
