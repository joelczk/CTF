A `robots.txt` file on a website that tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or cannot request from the site.

Visiting the robots.txt site, we get the following:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /1bb4c.html
```

Now, we try to visit `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/1bb4c.html`. From this page, we have found the flag.

Flag is : `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}`
